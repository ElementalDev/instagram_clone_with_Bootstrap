# Instagram Clone Sign up Page

## What is it?:

This is an clone of the instagram sign in page, including images, buttons and inputs you would normally find on the origin page.

Several commits were made to make sure there is a good history of changes made, incase I need to revert back to one of them.

The editor I used is Atom, using only HTML and CSS.

Please enjoy viewing it as much as I enjoyed creating it!

## How to use:

1. Download the files to your computer - either clone the repo or download it.
	• Windows/Mac OSX - Download repo or clone from GitHub
	• Mac OSX/Linux/Other - install git and use the "git clone" command to clone the repository

2. Open the index.html file
	• Windows/Mac OSX - Double click or drag and drop the file into a browser
	• Mac OSX/Linux/Other - cd to the downloaded file and type "open index.html"
